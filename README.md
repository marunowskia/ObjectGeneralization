### Problem:
- Autogenerated code is terrible to work with
- Java is terrible to work with

### Solution:
- Autogenerate more code in Java :trollface:

*Wait! Come back! It totally works!*

# ObjectGeneralization:

This project aims to make life easier in two ways:
- Resolve some common problems with POJOs which have been autogenerated
- Remove some basic annoyances from java itself (null checks, verbosity)

#### Ideal use cases:
- hibernate entities
- cxf-codegen/wsdl2java/xjc output objects
- swagger-codegen objects
- Deeply nested object models

#### Restrictions:
- Your type hierarchy must not contain loops
- Your POJOs must use javabean style getters (getX, isY)
